I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at TU Dortmund, Germany. I will join National Tsing Hua University as an assistant professor in August, 2025.

My research focuses on operating systems, file systems, databases, and computer architecture. If you enjoy building real-world systems and infrastructure, this could be a great opportunity for you! I have extensive experience with open-source system projects.  I also have strong collaborations with researchers in Germany.  We have opportunities for international research exchange.

I am always looking for motivated students who are passionate about system research.  If you’re interested, feel free to reach out! Let’s build something exciting together!

我們的研究團隊正在尋找對系統研究充滿熱情的學生！無論你想找碩班、博班指導老師、大學專題研究，都歡迎寄信給我，一起聊聊。

我跟德國的研究團隊保持緊密合作，提供國際交換的機會。
