I received PhD degree in 2023 from National Taiwan University, Computer Science \& Information Engineering, supervised by Prof. Tei-Wei Kuo.
I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at TU Dortmund, Germany.
My PhD dissertation introduced vertical integration solutions for storage systems that leveraged application semantics to optimize hardware request scheduling and reduce error correction costs.
Another key contribution of my dissertation was a processing-in-memory chip with an emphasis on real-world applicability. Instead of adding a dedicated processor, I re-purposed existing logic in memory chips for highly parallel data matching while preserving their traditional roles in read-out and memory management. The result was a cost-effective, versatile chip that significantly reduced the database system’s dependency on power-hungry DRAM-based caches. This work won the **Best Paper Award in 2024 CODES+ISSS conference (1 out of 198 papers)**.

My ongoing research focuses on designing sustainable and fault-tolerant memory systems to tackle the declining reliability issue in modern memory technologies. 
In the long term, I aim to design modular and flexible architectural support for heterogeneous, highly-integrated SoCs.  This support will enable efficient execution of different computation phases in a data pipeline across diverse accelerators while providing an abstraction layer to manage the unique properties of various memory media.
